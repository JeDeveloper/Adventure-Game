Team Members: Temour Raza, Josh Evans, Josh Shapiro

Update 0:
All code committed to GitHub.  Access given to Temour.

Update 1:
Player.java updated to communicate with Potion.java and Monster.java
Monster.java updated to return int values for attack functions.

Update 2:
Player.java now interfaces with Potion.java and Weapon.java - Monster communication removed.
Monster.java complete
Item.java complete
Weapon.java complete
Potion.java complete
LivingBeing.java complete

If I've marked them as //done, then functionally, they're done.  Add JeXML when ready, and all it needs is some name tweaks to match Batra's requirements.  We might need mergers later on to fit his class requirements as well.  It seems that JEvans' sections are the only unfinished ones, as JShap and TRaza just need to fix Backpack.java.
Class on Wednesday will consist of merging JShap and TRaza's stuff, while JEvans will complete the world implementations and XML saves.

GOALS:  COMPLETE BASIC GAME MECHANICS BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

Update 3:
All classes have been improved.  JeXML appears to work, Room.java, Door.java and World.java are still incomplete.  All Item.java inherited classes are complete.  Backpack is still buggy.
Wednesday - Friday: progress was incremental.  We definitely improved some stuff like the player and monster, but as a whole. it still is not fully functional.
